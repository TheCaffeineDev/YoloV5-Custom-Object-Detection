# Custom Object Detection With YoloV5

This repository contains a notebook to train your own custom object detector using YOLOv5. I have used the code of [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) to train the model. Make sure to check their repository also. It's great.

I have posted a detailed tutorial in medium. Here's the link:
